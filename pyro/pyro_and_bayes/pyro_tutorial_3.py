This script is part of a series of pyro tutorials. During these tutorials, we
will tackle a sequence of problems of increasing complexity that will take us
from understanding simple pyro concepts to fitting models via svi and finally
fitting a model involving hidden variables and neural networks.
The tutorials consist in the following:
    - key bayesian concepts                 (tutorial_0) 
    - first contact with pyro               (tutorial_1)
    - forward model and diagnosis           (tutorial_2)
    - data generation and analysis          (tutorial_3)
    - fitting simple model                  (tutorial_4)
    - fitting multivariate model            (tutorial_5)
    - fitting model with hidden variables   (tutorial_6)
    - fitting model with neural networks    (tutorial_7)

This script will create a more complicated forward model in pyro. The model 
creates a dataset of instrument drifts that will be analyzed and provides the
data for model fitting tasks in later tutorials. The model will generate several
batches of multivariate data with hidden variables and nonlinearities.

For this, do the following:
    1. Imports and definitions
    2. Create model architecture
    3. Create nonlinear features 
    4. Sample hidden variables
    5. Generate and save data
    6. Analyze data
    
The script is meant solely for educational and illustrative purposes. Written by
