This script is part of a series of pyro tutorials. During these tutorials, we
will tackle a sequence of problems of increasing complexity that will take us
from understanding simple pyro concepts to fitting models via svi and finally
fitting a model involving hidden variables and neural networks.
The tutorials consist in the following:
    - key bayesian concepts                 (tutorial_0) 
    - first contact with pyro               (tutorial_1)
    - forward model and diagnosis           (tutorial_2)
    - data generation and analysis          (tutorial_3)
    - fitting simple model                  (tutorial_4)
    - fitting multivariate model            (tutorial_5)
    - fitting model with hidden variables   (tutorial_6)
    - fitting model with neural networks    (tutorial_7)

This script will fit a typical regression model to the data generated in tutorial
3. This will neccesitate a stochastic model with multiple outputs and multiple
unknown parameters for which inference is to be performed. We again use stochastic 
variational inference and compare the outcome of the optimization to an analytical
solution derived via least squares. Special care is given to ensure that the
involved shapes in the model are well motivated and understandable.

For this, do the following:
    1. Imports and definitions
    2. Load and simplify data
    3. Define stochastic model 
    4. Define guide 
    5. Analyze shapes in model and guide
    6. Stochastic variational inference
    7. Comparison to analytical solution
