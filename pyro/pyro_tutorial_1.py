This script is part of a series of pyro tutorials. During these tutorials,
we will learn about tensors (part_1), use autograd and optimizers on a minimal
example (part_2), use torch for fitting a basic model via LS (part_3), learn
about pytorchs utility functions (part_4) and train a neural network to perform
a classification task (part_5). 

This script is to showcase the basic pytorch building block, the tensor. We will
figure out what a tensor is, how it compares to normal arrays and why tensors
are so useful in the context of optimization and ml.
For this, do the following:
    1. Imports and definitions
    2. Generate numpy array & check properties
    3. Generate torch tensor & check properties 
    4. Autograd functionality
    
The script is meant solely for educational and illustrative purposes. Written by
Jemil Avers Butt, Atlas optimization GmbH, www.atlasoptimization.com.
