This script is part of a series of pyro tutorials. During these tutorials, we
will tackle a sequence of problems of increasing complexity that will take us
from understanding simple pyro concepts to fitting models via svi and finally
fitting a model involving hidden variables and neural networks.
The tutorials consist in the following:
    - key bayesian concepts                 (tutorial_0) 
    - first contact with pyro               (tutorial_1)
    - forward model and diagnosis           (tutorial_2)
    - data generation and analysis          (tutorial_3)
    - fitting simple model                  (tutorial_4)
    - fitting multivariate model            (tutorial_5)
    - fitting model with hidden variables   (tutorial_6)
    - fitting model with neural networks    (tutorial_7)

This script will augment the regression model from the previous tutorial 
with a hidden latent random variable. Subsequently we arrive at a nontrivial
guide that encodes the posterior distribution of the latent variable given
the observation; the posterior density is subsequently being investigated.

For this, do the following:
    1. Imports and definitions
    2. Load the data
    3. Define stochastic model 
    4. Define guide 
    5. Stochastic variational inference
    6. Investigate the posterior density
    7. Comparison to analytical solution
