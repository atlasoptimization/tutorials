This script is part of a series of pyro tutorials. During these tutorials, we
will tackle a sequence of problems of increasing complexity that will take us
from understanding simple pyro concepts to fitting models via svi and finally
fitting a model involving hidden variables and neural networs.
The tutorials consist in the following:
    - key bayesian concepts                 (tutorial_0) 
    - first contact with pyro               (tutorial_1)
    - forward model and diagnosis           (tutorial_2)
    - data generation and analysis          (tutorial_3)
    - fitting simple model                  (tutorial_4)
    - fitting multivariate model            (tutorial_5)
    - fitting model with hidden variables   (tutorial_6)
    - fitting model with neural networks    (tutorial_7)

This script is to showcase key bayesian concepts and how implementing them in 
python will hit some roadblocks that require proper bookkeeping and numerics
thereby motivating the use of probabilistic programming languages like pyro.
The toy example to which we will apply bayesian analysis aims to investigate
some unknown properties of a measurement instrument.

    6. Distributions vs point estimates
    7. Some roadbloacks and outlook
