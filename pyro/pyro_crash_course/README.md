# ðŸš€ Pyro Crash Course

Welcome to the **Atlas Optimization Pyro Crash Course**!  
In this quick, hands-on series, you'll learn how to:

- Build probabilistic models (linear, hierarchical, and nonlinear)
- Fit models using Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI)
- Handle discrete latent variables
- Incorporate neural networks into probabilistic workflows

We illustrate all concepts using a simple **thermal sensor calibration** problem â€“ no prior physics knowledge required.

## How to Start ðŸš€

1. Watch the companion videos on [youtube](https://youtube.com) if you like more context
2. Open the first sprint notebook here:  
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/atlas-optimization/tutorials/blob/main/pyro/pyro_crash_course/pyro_cc_1_minimal_inference.ipynb)

3. Run the installation & data generation cells.
4. Dive into modeling, inference, and critical thinking!
5. Rinse and repeat with examples of increasing complexity.
